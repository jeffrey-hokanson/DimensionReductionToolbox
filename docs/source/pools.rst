Computational Pools
===================


Design Philosophy
-----------------
There are a wide variety of approaches for working with parallelism 
in this context.
For example,....

Here we take a simple perspective: all functions are black-boxes
so all we need to pass the coordinate to evaluate the function at 
and (optionally) the number of derivatives to compute.
