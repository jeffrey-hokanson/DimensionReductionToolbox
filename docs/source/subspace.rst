Subspace-based Dimension Reduction
==================================

Here our goal is to find a subspace along which our quantity of interest varies the most,
for various definitions of *most*.

.. autoclass:: psdr.SubspaceBasedDimensionReduction
   :members:


Active Subspace
===============

.. autoclass:: psdr.ActiveSubspace


Lipschitz Matrix
================

.. autoclass:: psdr.LipschitzMatrix
   :members: M, L
